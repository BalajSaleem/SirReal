# SirReal
A 2D sidescrolling platformer implemented using Unity.
The game contains thousands of graphics assets and hence this repository simply contains the scripts used in the game.
All these scripts are executable only in the unity namespace and contain behavioural logic for player and the automations for the npcs.
